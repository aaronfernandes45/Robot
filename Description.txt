Chain Reaction is a strategy game for multiple players 
The aim is to take control of the board by eliminating the opponent's orbs.
Players place their orbs in the cells by turns. 
Each cell however, has a limit for maximum number of orbs.
The limit depends on the type of cell you choose 
The corners have two adjacent cells only, hence their limit would be 2. 
Similarly, the limit for edge cells (excluding corners) is 3 and 4 for cells in the middle 
Once a cell reaches it's limit, placing an orb into it would result the cell to pop into it's adjacent cells 
This would result in adding an extra orb to those adjacent cells and claiming it for the player 
A player may place an orb only in a blank cell or a cell containing their orb. 
A player loses once they lose all their orbs
