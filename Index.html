	<p class="para para2" >Chain Reaction is a strategy game for multiple players <br> The aim is to take control of the board by eliminating the opponent's orbs.<br> Players place their orbs in the cells by turns. <br> Each cell however, has a limit for maximum number of orbs.<br>The limit depends on the type of cell you choose <br> The corners have two adjacent cells only, hence their limit would be 2. <br> Similarly, the limit for edge cells (excluding corners) is 3 and 4 for cells in the middle <br> Once a cell reaches it's limit, placing an orb into it would pop the cell into it's adjacent cells <br>This would result in adding an extra orb to those adjacent cells and claiming it for the player <br> A player may place an orb only in a blank cell or a cell containing their orb. <br> A player loses once they lose all their orbs<br>
